# Design System Book

## Which kind

Decide before copying anything. `specs/design-system/design-site-navigation/spec.md`
decides whether the page exists at all.

| Kind | Template |
| :--- | :--- |
| Base — what ships, its values, what it applies to | `books/templates/base.mdx` |
| Principles — how to choose, and what goes wrong | `books/templates/principles.mdx` |
| Component — a schema | `books/templates/component.mdx` |

A book states decisions already made. If one is missing, read `docs/DESIGN.md`, then
`AGENTS.md`, then ask a human. Do not settle it in prose.

## Writing it

Copy the template to `apps/design/src/content/<group>/<slug>.mdx`. That file is the book.
The `h1` renders from `title`; do not write one.

Anything that ships in source comes from a specimen that reads it, never from prose.

Read the component's own header comment and its spec before writing. What resolves when,
what a value inherits, and where the implementation departs from v20 are stated there and
nowhere else.

## Voice

Read `/principles/typography` before writing: it is the exemplar, set by the owner.
First person plural, declarative, no contractions. Every choice carries its
rationale — comparative where alternatives were live, quantified where numbers
exist. A book documents only what ships.

## Before the pull request

Cut a paragraph a competent reader could have written without this repository.

Never: "not X, but Y". An aphorism closing a paragraph. A knowing aside.
`grep -nwE 'easy|simply|quick|just'` returns nothing.
